### New features

- Initial release of Hoverdrive with two endpoints:

  - `/hoverdrive/column-docs-links{?table,column,redirect}` to get documentation links for TAP columns.
  - `/hoverdrive/table-docs-links{?table,redirect}` to get documentation links for TAP tables.

  At the moment, only `redirect=true` requests are supported since the VOTable response type is not yet implemented.
